My name is John, I am a telecommunications engineer with over 7+ years of experience with skills in software development, machine learning and data center infrastructure.<br>
In my early years as an engineer I got a chance to work in a fullstack project using Java and Oracle which helped me to increase my knowledge about the MVC model, OOP and databases.<br>
Later on, my career focused more on infrastructure and how to integrate different equipments and technologies in a data center.<br>
During those years, I further developed my expertise in switches, routers, servers, storages, virtualization, firewalls, VoIP, wireless, and monitoring softwares.<br>
Nowadays, I am more involved in expanding my knowledge in frontend and backend applications using python and javascript. Moreover, I am working on building ML models using python and integrate them with frontend applications to be used by customers.<br>
